# Container with SCIF Apps

## Generation

1. First make sure you have installed Singularity 
   (http://singularity.lbl.gov/install-linux)

2. To generate a SCI-F app, you can start with a recipe (Singularity) and 
   use it to bootstrap a new container image:

      # Singularity 2.4+
      sudo singularity build container.simg Singularity

      # Singularity Legacy (before 2.4)
      singularity create --size 2000 container.img
      sudo singularity bootstrap container.img Singularity

3. If you downloaded the zip from sci-f, you should be able to unzip
   it, create the container, and run the command above.

   unzip SingularityRecipe.scif.zip
   <build container>


## Usage

%help

A Scientific Filesystem (SCI-F) app
makes it easy to run various  metrics over an 
analysis of interest  (the container's 
main runscript). Each installed 
app can be thought of as a particular context 
to evoke the container's main runscript.

# List all apps
singularity apps <container>

# Run a specific app
singularity run --app <app> <container>

# Loop over all apps
for app in $(singularity apps metrics.img); do
    singularity run --app $app metrics.img
done
