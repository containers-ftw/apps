<b>SCI-F</b> refers to the <b>Scientific Filesystem</b> specifically designed to allow for internal
modularity and reproducibility of scientific containers (or anywhere else a filesystem can be installed).

<!--more--> 

<p>SCI-F is an organizational format that is intended to make it easy to generate internally modular containers. This means any of the following:

<ul class="list">
  <li>Record metrics and resource usage for the container's primary function.</li>
  <li>Modular (different) software within the same container.</li>
  <li>General linters, tests, or logging.</li>
  <li>Helpers for running under different contexts.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each of the above, this functionality comes by way of different "apps" that are installed in the container. An app can carry it's own set of files, environment variables, metadata, help, and runscript. This website is a base for sharing, and finding apps that could be useful to you!</p>
<p>To get started, you should <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k0I1M1BIR1aqGxVVJrow_Gj3T8BXHco-oqnreYKuxL8/edit#" target="_blank">read about</a> the standard, and clone the <a href="" target="_blank">development branch</a> of Singularity to try creating a container with apps. If you want your app to appear here, simply <a href="https://www.github.com/sci-f/sci-f.gitub.io" target="_blank">add a folder</a> to the repo in the <strong>_apps</strong> folder, which should be linked to <strong>_api</strong>. That's it!</p>
<p>SCI-F Apps are a sibling to <a href="https://www.singularity-hub.org" target="_blank">Singularity Hub</a> and a proud part of the open source <a href="https://singularityware.github.io" target="_blank">Singularity </a> containers project. Thanks for visiting!</p>
